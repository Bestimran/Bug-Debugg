        <li class="storage">What is the Difference between LocalStorage and sessionStorage?</li>
        <p class="text">sessionStorage is similar to localStorage ; the difference is that while data in localStorage doesn't expire, data in sessionStorage is cleared when the page session ends. <br> Whenever a document is loaded in a particular tab in the browser, a unique page session gets created and assigned to that particular tab.</p> <br>
        <li class="storage">What is the between block scope and global scope?</li>
        <p class="text">Function Scope: When a variable is declared inside a function, it is only accessible within that function and cannot be used outside that function. <br>  Block Scope: A variable when declared inside the if or switch conditions or inside for or while loops.</p><br>
        <li class="storage">How JavaScript's Event Loop Works?</li>
        <p class="text">The Event Loop has one simple job â€” to monitor the Call Stack and the Callback Queue. If the Call Stack is empty, the Event Loop will take the first event from the queue and will push it to the Call Stack, <br>  which effectively runs it. Such an iteration is called a tick in the Event Loop.</p><br>
        <li class="storage">How to get undefined in javascript?</li>
        <p class="text">You will get undefined value when you call a non-existent property or method of an object. In the above example, a function Sum does not return any result but still we try to assign its resulted value to a variable. <br> So in this case, result will be undefined.</p>
